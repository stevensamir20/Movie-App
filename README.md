# Movie Application

* This is a movie application built with Angular. The application features Services, Guards, Routing, API Calls, and Pipes to provide a seamless user experience.
* This project was graduation project of Banque Misr summer internship program for Frontend web developers

## Features
* **Services:** The application utilizes Services to manage data retrieval and manipulation. The Services are used to fetch movie data from a remote server and transform it to suit the application's needs.

* **Guards:** Guards are used to protect routes from unauthorized access. For instance, the application uses Guards to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages.

* **Routing:** The application incorporates Routing to enable easy navigation between different pages. Users can switch between the home page, movie detail page, and search page with ease.

* **API Calls:** The application uses API Calls to fetch movie data from a remote server. Axios is used to handle the API requests, and the data is fetched in real-time to ensure that users get the most up-to-date information.

* **Pipes:** Pipes are used to transform and format data for display. For instance, the application uses Pipes to format dates and currency values, making the data more readable for users.
